def batched_nms(boxes, scores, idxs, iou_threshold):
    """
    Performs non-maximum suppression in a batched fashion.

    Each index value correspond to a category, and NMS
    will not be applied between elements of different categories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : Tensor[N, 4]
        boxes where NMS will be performed. They
        are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format
    scores : Tensor[N]
        scores for each one of the boxes
    idxs : Tensor[N]
        indices of the categories for each one of the boxes.
    iou_threshold : float
        discards all overlapping boxes
        with IoU < iou_threshold

    Returns
    -------
    keep : Tensor
        int64 tensor with the indices of
        the elements that have been kept by NMS, sorted
        in decreasing order of scores
